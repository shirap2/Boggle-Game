Exercise 12: Boggle Game
Authors: Talia Dym, Shira Parker
Description :
When the user starts the program a window pops up with an image and a 
start button that the user can press in order to start the game.
We designed the boggle game screen in the colours: 
yellow and blue to match the colours of the original boggle game.
Each turn, the user can select letters from the board by pressing the letter buttons on the screen 
and then pressing the enter button (signaling the end of the turn).
As the user presses the letters, a string of the chosen letters appears on the bottom of the screen 
The program checks the letter path the user has selcted. 
If the path is correct it shows an according message, updates the game score displayed on the screen 
and adds the correct word to a list of found words displayed on the screen.
If the path is incorrect, an according message is displayed.
The game also has an option for the user to ask for a hint.
If the user chooses to ask for a hint by pressing the hint button, 1 point is removed  
from the total score and a word from the from the board appears on the screen (in the hint frame). 
We used the function max_score_paths from ex12_utils to help get the hint.
If the user has less than 1 point, they cannot get a hint
and if they press the hint button, an according message is displayed 
The game ends when the time runs out. 
Then a message box is displayed giving the user the option to choose whether to play again or not.
We hope you enjoy our game!
